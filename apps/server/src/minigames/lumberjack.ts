/**
 * The Woodlot — a money-only SKILL JOB (no character, no relationship). Time each
 * axe swing into the log's "grain" zone; the zone narrows and the swing quickens
 * with every log as your arms tire. Mechanically a cousin of `timing_meter`, but:
 *  - it rewards COIN only (rewardsCharacter: false, no targetStats), so it runs in
 *    the framework's character-null "job mode" (money flows to the world wallet),
 *  - it pays a higher base than the dating games (a worked S-grade should beat a
 *    no-skill flat shift), and
 *  - the GRADE is driven by a server-derived combo, not just average accuracy, so
 *    sustained clean swings — the real skill — matter.
