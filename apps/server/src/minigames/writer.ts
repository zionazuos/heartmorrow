/**
 * The Copy Desk — a money-only SKILL JOB (no character, no relationship): take a
 * freelance writing commission for the world's broadsheet and set the editor's copy
 * cleanly before the press run. The copy is a short, world-flavored newspaper
 * dispatch the player TRANSCRIBES verbatim; pay is graded on precision (primary)
 * and speed (a sweetener). The LLM writes the dispatch when a world exists; when it
 * can't (offline / generation fails), a deterministic fallback is assembled from the
 * world's own fields — work must ALWAYS be clickable, never blocked on the model.
 *
 * Security model mirrors lore-quiz: the passage is sent to the client (you can't type
 * what you can't see), but the SERVER keeps its own copy as the answer key in `state`
 * and scores the submission against it — the client only submits the raw typed text.
