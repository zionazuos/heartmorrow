 * Work & "Together" activities — each costs a daily action (1 stamina) and passes
 * time. WORK earns money. TOGETHER is unstructured time spent with a chosen
 * character: it nudges a single relationship stat, but — unlike a flat grind — the
 * payoff is shaped by who they are (fit), how bold the outing is (risk), and how
 * much you've already leaned on them today (a per-person daily cap). Crucially,
 * casual time can only carry a bond so far: it never touches AFFECTION and tapers
 * to nothing near {@link TOGETHER_SOFT_CEILING}, so real DATES remain the only road
 * to the romantic bands. Effect magnitudes are server-defined here (never client-
 * supplied) and resolved by {@link resolveTogether}.
